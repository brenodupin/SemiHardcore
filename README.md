# SemiHardcore
A simple plugin that deletes a percentage of items on a Player Death. This percentage changes the more the player survives until it reaches a minimum. The percentage values can be changed on the config.yml file.

Defaults values are:  
start-percentage: 80  
end-percentage: 50 (minimum)  
decrement-percentage: 0.2  
The decrement happens when a player survives an entire day (2400 ticks).
